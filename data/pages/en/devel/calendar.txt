====== Calendar Development ======

===== Integrate Custom Modules =====

For a custom module to be correctly supported in the Calendar module it must register itself by creating a few records in two tables.

==== Module Fields Definitions ====

This table indicates the base start and end date fields and a comma separated list of fields to show in the popup summary box.

The table is //its4you_calendar_modulefields// and you can see an example looking at the code we use to fill in this table for the default modules (build/changeSets/ModulesOnCalendar.php).

==== Module Status Definitions ====

This table indicates the search conditions to be used when filtering records on the calendar.

You can give search conditions for three status:
  * **Planned**
  * **Held**
  * **Not Held**

The table is //its4you_calendar_modulestatus// and you can see an example looking at the code we use to fill in this table for the default modules (build/changeSets/ModulesOnCalendar.php).


===== Timezone tests =====

In order to verify timezone on the calendar with DST changes I did this test. With the computer unconnected to the internet and set to mid-October, I create 18 calendar events, 6 for each of 3 users. The 6 events are 3 before DST change and 3 after the change. The 3 users are on UTC-3, UTC+1 (DST) and UTC. The database is set to UTC which is how it should be always.

This looks like this:

| |  testtz-3  |  testtz |  testymd  |
| |  UTC-3  |  UTC+1  |  UTC  |
|15/10/17 10:00| | |
|15/10/17 23:30| | |
|16/10/17 00:30| | |
|04/11/17 10:00| | |
|04/11/17 23:30| | |
|05/11/17 00:30| | |


I visually verify that all users see the events where they should appear. I enter as an admin user and see all events of all 3 users correctly situated by the timezone of the admin user.

Now I reboot the computer and set the date to the second of November in the BIOS.

I access coreBOS and visually verify that all users see the events where they should appear. I enter as an admin user and see all events of all 3 users correctly situated by the timezone of the admin user.

I create a Report on the events and verify that all three users see the events correctly and that the admin user also sees them all correctly.

I verify that the detail view is also correct.

I create an event with repeat over the DST weekend and verify that all events are created correctly.

I also verify that all the date information saved in the database is correct.
