  * Allowed **<scope>** could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example a module name, webservice or functional feature
  * **<subject>** line contains succinct description of the change. Use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”. If the commit fixes or is related to a ticket we will put the [[https://www.mantisbt.org/|MantisBT]] regular expression here
