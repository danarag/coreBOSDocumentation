====== Add Encryption/Decryption methods to Confidential Information module ======

These are the steps that need to be taken in order to implement a new encryption/decryption method:

  * Add your new method to the switch case in encryptFields defining your encryption method function
  * Add your new method to the switch case in decryptFields defining your decryption method function
  * Add your new NONCE method to the switch case in getNONCE defining your method function to obtain the unique encryption code
  * Define the methods themselves following the code examples of the ones that already exist
  * Add your method to configuration
  * Add any functionality you may require
  * Check and adjust the migrate to new password method: most probably you will not have to do anything here
