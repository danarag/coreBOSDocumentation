====== Errorneous Changesets ======

Here you will find a list of changesets we have added to the system and that introduced some irreversible change or some data loss.

Obviously, we try hard to verify and double check the changesets but the diversity of installs and complexity of the system imposes that, from time to time, some error happens.

Your best safeguard against these errors are database backups
