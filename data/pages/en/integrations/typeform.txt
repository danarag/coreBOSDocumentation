==== Typeform Configuration ====

Configuring the application to read Typeform surveys consists of various steps detailed next:

  * Create the survey in Typeform
  * Create a notification by email for the survey. The email must have this subject:<code>Typeform::<surveyid>::<surveyurl></code>
    * //surveyid// is the internal identifier assigned by Typeform
    * //surveyurl// is the url of the survey

  * Configure Email Converter in the application so it can read the Typeform notifications

{{ :en:integrations:typeform:cbcrm_typeform_scanner_config.png?730 |}}

  * Configure the Typeform API access key in **Settings > Configuration Editor**
  * That's it, with those two changes, coreBOSCRM will receive an email each time a survey is completed and it will be registered in the application.
  * Now you can create workflows associated to the creation event of the different records to have the system act upon them.

==== Typeform Implementation ====

  * Read surveyid from mail subject
  * Read typeform json
  * If survey doesn't exist > create it with stats and info
  * If it exists > update stats
  * Foreach questions > upsert
  * Foreach responses
    * Get ACL and email
    * Attach email to ACL
    * Check if done
    * If exists > ignore
    * If not > create with meta data 
    * Foreach answer > create answer
    * Update lastsync datetime

TBD  FIXME  Check all this, document it!

  * Limitation. Only works with existing ACL. **??? Really, no anonymous surveys ??? ######**
