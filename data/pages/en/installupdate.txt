How to install and update the application

====== Download ======

We make changes every day so you can apply the above procedure every day to get the latest changes. Note that the application version numbers are TOTALLY irrelevant, they have no meaning at all except for marketing.

The ideal situation is that you have your install under git control. That means that instead of downloading the zip from github you executed "git clone", if you did that, updating the code to the latest release is just "git pull". Then you launch the updater and you are done

In other words once you are on coreBOS there is no more migration scripts nor version numbers there is just: update code and apply changes, forever...
