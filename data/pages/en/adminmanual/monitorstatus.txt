===== Monitor the health of your coreBOS =====

If you would like to add your coreBOS install into your company's **IT Infrastructure Health Monitoring** system, the **ping** functionality is exactly what you are looking for.

This feature is expressly designed to be called from a tool like [[https://www.nagios.org/|Nagios]] or [[https://pandorafms.com|Pandora]] and will execute a set of 10 tests against your coreBOS install. Actually 11 if you consider accessing the script itself as a test.

You must call the URL:

http://your_server/your_corebos/ping.php

which must be accessible either using a user and password to overcome any apache authentication screen or by [[https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos/blob/master/htaccess.txt|explicitly excluding it]] from the authentication in the .htaccess file.

The script will return the string

<code>OK: basic testing has passed</code>

if all tests pass or one of the next error messages depending on the failure detected:

  * NOK: incorrect PHP version
  * NOK: no configuration file
  * NOK: no database configuration
  * NOK: no version file
  * NOK: no version configuration
  * NOK: missing program files: vtlib
  * NOK: version mismatch
  * NOK: could not access database
  * NOK: missing program file: users
  * NOK: missing admin user file
