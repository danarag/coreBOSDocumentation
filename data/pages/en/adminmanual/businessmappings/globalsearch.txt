====== Global Search Autocomplete Mapping ======

This business map is really a configuration setting. Most business maps are generic, whereas you can use them on many modules or for various purposes. This mapping is, specifically, to define the set of modules and fields you want to launch a reduced global search on.

As of the creation and implementation of this map, if it exists, you will be able to start writing in the global search text box to get an autocomplete dropdown with values that it finds in the modules and fields defined in the mapping.

<code xml>
<map>
  <mincharstosearch>3</mincharstosearch>
  <maxresults>10</maxresults>
  <searchin>
    <module>
      <name>Potentials</name>
      <searchfields>field1,field2,...,fieldn</searchfields>
      <searchcondition>startswith|contains</searchcondition>
      <showfields>field1,field2,...,fieldn</showfields>
    </module>
   ...
  </searchin>
</map>
</code>

As usual, the mere existence of the mapping with the name **GlobalSearchAutocomplete** will activate the functionality and, as with all business maps you can define it using the global variable **BusinessMap_GlobalSearchAutocomplete** to apply it only to certain users.

This feature was implemented by [[https://github.com/AlbanaCelepija|Albana]]: Thank you!!

This is the map I used to test it:

<code xml>
<map>
  <mincharstosearch>2</mincharstosearch>
  <maxresults>10</maxresults>
  <searchin>
    <module>
      <name>Potentials</name>
      <searchfields>potentialname,sales_stage,amount</searchfields>
      <searchcondition>startswith</searchcondition>
      <showfields>potentialname,sales_stage,amount,forecast_amount</showfields>
    </module>
    <module>
      <name>Accounts</name>
      <searchfields>accountname,industry,employees</searchfields>
      <searchcondition>startswith</searchcondition>
      <showfields>accountname,industry,employees,email1</showfields>
    </module>
  </searchin>
</map>
