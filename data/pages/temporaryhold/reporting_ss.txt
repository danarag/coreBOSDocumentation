====== vtigerCRM-Spain::Reporting Screen shots ======

===== Pentaho - vtiger CRM Integration =====

The first screen shot is the Pentaho Welcome screen. Notice the elements we have added in the left menu.\\
{{vtbi:pentaho01.png|Pentaho welcome screen}}\\
\\
\\
The next two screen shots show a simple Audit report and how nicely Pentaho Report Designer permits parameter introduction\\
{{vtbi:audit01.png|}}\\
\\
{{vtbi:audit02.png|}}\\
\\
This is the first OLAP cube of the payments cube\\
{{vtbi:analysis01.png|}}\\
\\
These are the dimensions we can navigate and study on\\
{{vtbi:analysis02.png|}}\\
\\
In the next screen I have changed the initial cube to contact city by year\\
{{vtbi:analysis03.png|}}\\
\\
This is how that last configuration looks\\
{{vtbi:analysis04.png|}}\\
\\
This is the same cube but with yearly payment opened up. Anybody who has played with OLAP before knows how easy and stimulating navigating through your data is!!\\
{{vtbi:analysis05.png|}}\\
\\
The same cube with cities opened up\\
{{vtbi:analysis06.png|}}\\
\\
This can just as easily be taken to quartely payments by years with a graph. Impressive!!\\
{{vtbi:analysis07.png|}}\\
\\
In the next two screen shots you can see some of the dimensions and measures that can be used while studying invoices\\
{{vtbi:analysisfact01.png|}}\\
{{vtbi:analysisfact02.png|}}\\
\\
Here we can see HelpDesk measures that can be used\\
{{vtbi:analysishd.png|}}\\
\\
and finally a state of the Potentials cube\\

This is the Trouble Ticket screen of one of our clients. It is a customized version of vtiger CRM.\\

These are two screen shots of the generated report. BIRT will automatically take care of PDF and other output formats\\
{{vtbi:episodio01.png|}}\\

Notice the cross tab grid between dates and products. BIRT is an exceptional product!!!\\
