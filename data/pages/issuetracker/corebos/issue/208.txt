====== 208: Add support for CORS to facilitate javascript REST coding  ======

Issue Reference in Tracker: ~~issue:208~~.


===== Detailed Explanation =====

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing|Cross origin resource sharing]]

We have added a Global Variable which must contain the list of valid domains/IPs we will accept webservice requests from.

The variable is called //Webservice_CORS_Enabled_Domains//

The variable can have two types of values:
  * asterisk <wrap hi>*</wrap> which means that all origin domains are accepted
  * a space or comma separated list of domains that will be searched for inclusion
